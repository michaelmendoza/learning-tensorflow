# Learning Tensorflow
![Supports TFv2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supports-tensorflow%20v2.0-blue.svg)

This tutorial was created for learning tensorflow by example. Currently this repo contains examples for a simple single-layer neural network, a multi-layered perception neural network, and a convolutional neural network. Tensorflow implementations in this repo work with a variety of data sets. Included are simple examples using keras sequential API and more advanced examples using the imperative style of creating networks with model subclassing API.

### Getting Started
Installation requires python 3 with tensorflow. The easiest method to install the requisite libraries is to install the [conda package manager](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Then run the following command to install necessary libraries and create a virtual environment call `tf`:

```
conda create -n tf python=3.6 numpy matplotlib scikit-image tqdm pycairo
```

If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU install tensorflow-gpu: `pip install tensorflow-gpu`
Otherwise use: `pip install tensorflow`

Activate this virtual environment with `source activate tf` (Mac) or `activate tf` (PC).

### Notes

**Update**: Updated examples for use with tensorflow 2.0!

If you are using older version of Tensorflow like 1.12, please look [here](https://github.com/michaelmendoza/learning-tensorflow/blob/tf-v1.12/README.md)
